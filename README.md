<h1>Installation</h1> 
pretty easy to install it might take a while but it is worth it remember to make sure you have Go and Python3 installed plus pip for this to work 
you might come across errors if you do please let me know so i can fix them. The Nmap NSE scripts might not be pre installed with nmap so if its not 
please go ahead and install them thanks.
